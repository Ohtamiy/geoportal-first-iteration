An Interactive System for Monitoring the State of Urban Infrastructure

  A prototype municipal geographic information system for the city of Chernihiv was developed to identify opportunities and test the concept before full implementation. This prototype demonstrates the main functions of the system, such as geodata visualization, spatial information analysis and interactive interaction with geospatial data.
  The development process used the PostGIS database for storing and processing spatial data, AWS technologies to ensure high availability and scalability of the system, and Node.js to implement the server side, which allowed optimizing the speed and efficiency of the system.
  The front-end part is represented by the popular React.js library for better control of all system functions. To present the use of the developed technology, a simple page with a map display and a navigation menu was created, which allows you to select layers of map display (potential split marks for each specific municipal service), administrative settings, and view critical issues by category.

  The chatbot was developed for the modern and popular Telegram messenger using the Python telegram library and the telegram extension. To demonstrate the use of the developed technology, a conversation with the chatbot was started, a personal contact was shared, and a user role was assigned.
  Then you can report a problem using the corresponding menu button.

  This prototype is an important step toward improving geographic information systems for municipalities, emphasizing the importance of modern tools and approaches to optimizing spatial data in the context of municipal governance.
